#### Project Summary: Student Performance Analysis and Prediction

##### Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student performance using a dataset containing over 4000 student records, including subjects and corresponding grades. The project leverages data exploration, machine learning models, and deep learning techniques to derive insights and forecast future performance.

##### Key Components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Conducts an initial investigation of the dataset, including statistical summaries and visualizations.

- Identifies missing values, outliers, and patterns in student performance across different subjects.

- Utilizes various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization and analysis.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model:

- Implements the KNN algorithm to classify or predict student grades based on historical data.

- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics and cross-validation techniques.

- Tunes hyperparameters to optimize prediction results.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):

- Builds an RNN model to analyze sequential student performance data.

- Explores different architectures to improve prediction accuracy.

- Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for model implementation.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model:

- Develops an LSTM-based deep learning model for time-series prediction of student grades.

- Leverages historical academic records to forecast future performance trends.

- Compares LSTM results with traditional machine learning models to assess effectiveness.

#### Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into student performance patterns and enables data-driven decision-making in educational institutions. The combination of traditional ML algorithms and deep learning approaches ensures robust predictions and meaningful analytics for academic success.
